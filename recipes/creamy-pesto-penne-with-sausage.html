<h2>Creamy Pesto Penne with Sausage</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
  <li>½ pound ground sausage</li>
  <li>1 (1.2 ounce) package creamy pesto sauce mix</li>
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>

  <li>Whisk pesto sauce mix, milk, and olive oil together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes; pour over pasta and sausage mixture and toss to coat.</li>
